# CSE-406: Computer Security Sessional

Welcome to the **CSE-406: Computer Security Sessional** repository! This course focused on various aspects of computer security, including cryptographic implementations, attack prevention mechanisms, and real-world incident response systems. While certain implementations are not shared publicly due to security risks, this repository provides an overview of the assignments and projects completed as part of the course.

## Introduction

In **CSE-406**, we explored fundamental concepts of computer security, including:

- **Buffer Overflow Attacks**: Understanding how they work, why they occur, and how to prevent them.
- **XSS and CSRF Attacks**: Studying cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and the role of CSRF tokens in preventing them.

Due to the sensitive nature of these topics, implementations of attacks are not included in this repository.

## Assignments

### Offline 1: Cryptographic Exchange
Path: [Offline 1](./Offline%201)

In this assignment, a cryptographic system was implemented using a symmetric key for encryption and decryption. The symmetric key was securely exchanged using the **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)** key exchange method. The key features include:

- Implementation of ECDH to securely generate and exchange symmetric keys.
- Symmetric encryption and decryption of messages.
- Ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged data.

## Project: The Hive - Incident Response Platform

For the course project, my project partner and I prepared a presentation on **The Hive: Incident Response Platform**. The project involved:

- Exploring the features of The Hive, an open-source platform designed for incident response and threat management.
- Understanding how The Hive integrates with other tools for efficient handling of cybersecurity incidents.
- Preparing a detailed presentation covering its architecture, use cases, and benefits.
